About this Manual
-----------------
This is user manual for the CheckSum Tool. It is still work in progress,
as is the tool itself.

The most important chapter is the Quick Start chapter which show how to
get started with the CheckSum Tool. Other chapters have more in detail
information about the tool.

Quick Start
-----------
The main window of the tool contains toolbar,list of filenames and checksums
and statusbar. The toolbar has controls to most frequently used features,
like creating and verifying checksums and changing checksum type. The file
list contains filename (and some other attributes) and checksum for the file.
The statusbar show some status information from the tool, like amount of
files in the list.

Opening the File Containing Checksums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To open a file containing checksums, select File|Open from main menu. Or
click the first button in the toolbar.

In the dialog, browse for and select the file to open. At current version,
the tool only understands .svf, .md5 and .sha1 files.

If the tool can read the file, files in the checksum file are added into
the list in the main window. Checksums are also visible, but not yet
verified.

Verifying the Checksums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When there is files with checksums in the main window, those checksums can be
verified against checksums of actual files in disk. Select Checksums|Verify All
from the main menu or click verify icon from the toolbar.

The tool compares checksums in the main window and checksums calculated from
files in the disk. If the checksums are identical, "OK" text is added to
"Verified" column in the main window. After all files are checked message is
shown if all files were verified OK or not.

NOTE: Verifying might take some time if files are big.

Adding Files to the List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To add (more) files to the list, select File|Add Files... or File|Add Folder...
from the main menu. The former adds just one selected file, while the latter
adds contents of the selected folder.

NOTE: Files are added in selected folder, not in subfolders.

Saving File List to Checksum File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the main window contains list of files which have checksums calculated,
they can be saved to checksum file. Select File|Save or File|Save As... from
the main menu. Select the filename and location for the file.

NOTE: While you can change filename extension, you cannot change the checksum
type in this dialog. Changing the filename extension migh cause problems for
this tool and other programs reading the file.

Installing
----------
The easiest way to install CheckSum Tool is to download and run the installer
from http://checksumtool.sourceforge.net[]

Running the installer copies program- and documentation files to the system
and adds the tool to Windows Start-menu.
