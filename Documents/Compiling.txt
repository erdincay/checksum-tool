User manual files reside in Documents/Manual.

Manual uses AsciiDoc for lightweight markup that can be procecced to several other formats.
AsciiDoc files are .txt files with some embedded markup.

To process AsciiDoc files you'll need:
- Python (2.5.x recommended) from http://www.python.org
- AsciiDoc from http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/

Manual can be converted in command line:
- open command prompt

- run command:
  > python [path to asciidoc]/asciidoc.py Manual.txt

CheckSumTool's NAnt build file also contains a task for building manual.
