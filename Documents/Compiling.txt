Compiling CheckSumTool
----------------------

Sourceforge project page is:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/checksumtool/

Sources:
CheckSumTool sources are available from Bitbucket Mercurial repository:
https://bitbucket.org/kimmov/checksum-tool
or in SourceForge file releases


Tools needed:
- Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4:
  http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=191424 (ISO file)
  http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=191420 (Web install)
- The project was created using SharpDevelop 2.2 (free .Net IDE),
  and currently SharpDevelop 4.0 is used:
  http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/
  Project/solution files are compatible with Visual Studio 2010, so you can use
  either commercial version of Visual Studio or free Express edition:
  http://www.microsoft.com/Express/
- NSIS for compiling installer
  http://nsis.sourceforge.net/
- NAnt for automatic building
  http://nant.sourceforge.net/
  NAnt contrib -additional NAnt tasks are needed also
  http://nantcontrib.sourceforge.net/
- NUnit for unit testing
  http://www.nunit.org/

Additional (and useful tools):
- FxCop for checking coding errors:
  http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb429476.aspx
- StyleCop for checking coding style:
  http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/sourceanalysis

  
Compiling:
- Open the solution file Src/CheckSumTool.sln to your IDE.
- Compile the project.


NAnt:
- NAnt can be used to build the tool
- NAntContrib is also required (for supporting additional tasks used)
- Build file is Src/CheckSumTool.build

To use NAnt efficiently, add NAnt (or batch file calling it) onto your PATH-
environment variable. Run NAnt from Src-folder:
 nant /f:CheckSumTool.build <target>

Most important targets are:
 - clean : cleans the workspace from binary/temp files
 - debug : build debug target in workspace
 - release : build release target in workspace
 - svn_build : export sources from SVN and do a release build
 - distribution : build for distribution, export from SVN, build release-
   target, create source- and binary-zips and create installer


The User Manual
---------------

User manual files reside in Documents/Manual.

Manual uses AsciiDoc for lightweight markup that can be procecced to several other formats.
AsciiDoc files are .txt files with some embedded markup.

To process AsciiDoc files you'll need:
- Python (2.5.x recommended) from http://www.python.org
- AsciiDoc from http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/

Manual can be converted in command line:
- open command prompt
- go to Documents/Manual folder
- run command:
  > python [path to asciidoc]/asciidoc.py Manual.txt

CheckSumTool's NAnt build file also contains a task for building manual.


Setting the Version Number
--------------------------
Version number is set in two places:

- for executable program it is in end of file:
  Src/AssemblyInfo.cs
- for installer it is in begin of installer script:
  Installer/NSIS/CheckSumTool.nsi
