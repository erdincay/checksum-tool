Setting version numbers
=======================

$Id$

ChecksumTool version numbers are managed by the versions.ini file and
Tools/SetVersions.py script. When the script is run it sets version numbers
for all resources listed in the ini file.

SetVersions.py script usage:

!!! This script is work in progress !!!

The SetVersions.py script sets versions numbers in different components.
Components and version numbers to set are defined in configuration file. The
configuration file is Windows INI-file kind of file, with sections and values.

The section name is only descriptive for the resource to process. It gets
printed by the script when running.

All sections have these values:
- type
  Resource type to set
- description
  Short description of the resource (e.g. Installer) to set version
- path
  Relative path to the resource to process
- version
  Version string/number to set

Available types are:
CS-AssemblyInfo:
  Set version number to C# AssemblyInfo file. The script searches for line
  having assembly: AssemblyVersion -text and sets the version number.

NSIS: 
  Set version number to NSIS installer script. The installer script must have
  version defined with PRODUCT_VERSION -macro. For example:
  !define PRODUCT_VERSION "1.2.3"

For example:
[Installer]
type = NSIS
description = ChecksumTool NSIS Installer
path = Installer/NSIS/CheckSumTool.nsi
version = "0.6.0"
